# COVID-19 Pakistan Data Visualization 📊

This notebook project presents a detailed visual analysis of COVID-19 data related to **Pakistan**.
Using Python and standard data science libraries, we’ve visualized multiple trends and correlations
to understand how the pandemic evolved in the country.

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

This analysis includes:
- Daily and smoothed case trends
- Death rates (total and per million)
- Case Fatality Rate (CFR) over time
- Log-scale case growth analysis
- Scatter plots to examine correlations (e.g. hospital beds vs deaths)
- A correlation heatmap to find relationships among numeric variables

All plots are generated using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.

## 📁 Files Included

| File Name                          | Description                                      |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Covid_19_Pakistan_Raw_data.csv`  | The raw dataset (filtered for Pakistan)          |
| `Pakistan_COVID19_Visualization.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook with all visualizations and code |

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download both files above.
2. Open `Pakistan_COVID19_Visualization.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to generate the visualizations.

You’ll see line plots, scatter plots, CFR trends, and more — all focused on Pakistan’s data.

## 📊 Visualization Preview

- 📈 **Line Charts** – For total and new cases/deaths
- 🟡 **Scatter Plots** – To analyze variable relationships
- 🔁 **Log Scale** – To observe exponential case growth clearly
- 📉 **CFR Trends** – Death-to-case ratio over time
- 🔥 **Correlation Heatmap** – See how numeric features relate

---

## 🔗 Notes

- The raw data is assumed to come from a global COVID-19 dataset. Only Pakistan's portion is used here.
- Make sure the CSV file is in the same folder as the notebook when running.

## ✅ Summary

This project gives a quick but meaningful overview of how COVID-19 progressed in Pakistan, how health infrastructure relates to outcomes, and which metrics correlate the most.

Feel free to build on top of it, add new features, or customize the visuals.
